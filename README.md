# wifi-motion
Wifi motion detector using an esp8266, can see through objects, detector movement with a football size line of site. Logs wirelessly graphical data of real time movement through objects. 
<br>
<br>
• Must flash Arduino code to esp8266.
<br>
• Upon loading code, allow esp8266 to log on to your router, which is what is used to create the "line of site" located between the router and esp.
<br>
• It will show on serial monitor that it connected, then it will give an IP address. Type this in and you can detect motion through walls, even slightly movements!
<br>
• Must enter your router information in the code.
