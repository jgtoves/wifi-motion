# wifi-motion
Wifi motion detector using an esp8266, can see through objects, detect movement with a football size line of site. Logs wirelessly graphical data of real time movement through objects. 
<br>
<br>
• Must flash Arduino code to esp8266.
<br>
• Upon loading code, allow esp8266 to log on to your router, which is what is used to create the "line of site" located between the router and esp.
<br>
• It will show on serial monitor that it connected, then it will give an IP address. Type this in your web browser and you can detect motion through walls, even slight movements!
<br>
• Must enter your router information in the code.

# probe-motion
Probe motion detector using an esp8266, can use as radar based on devices around you, to detect people, movement, with a football size line of site. Logs wirelessly graphical data of real time movement. It includes a web interface.
<br>
<br>
• Must flash Arduino code to esp8266.
<br>
• Upon loading code, allow esp8266 to log on to your router, which is what is used to create the "line of site" located between the probe-device and esp.
<br>
• It will show on serial monitor that it connected, then it will give an IP address. Type this in your web browser and you can detect motion through walls, even slightly movements!
<br>
• Must enter your router information in code.
