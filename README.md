# wifi-motion
Wifi motion detector using an esp8266, can see through objects, detect movement with a football size line of site using water in objects that decrease signal strength. Logs wirelessly graphical data of real time movement through objects. 
<br>
<br>
• Must flash Arduino code to esp8266.
<br>
• Upon loading code, allow esp8266 to log on to your router, which is what is used to create the "line of site" located between the router and esp.
<br>
• It will show on serial monitor that it connected, then it will give an IP address. Type this in your web browser and you can detect motion through walls, even slight movements!
<br>
• Must enter your router information in the code.

● Tip: the constant wiggles apparently suggests a breathing person, it's his chest inhaling and exhaling creating constant movement between router and esp8266. Additionally, a big, slow V is likely to be an adult, and a smaller v that is fast is likely a younger person.
